# Realtime Bridge

This is a very minimalistic library designed using a subscription-based model to listen to REST API endpoint changes.

The philosophy is that these subscription endpoints exist adjacent to REST API endpoints and allow the user to "subscribe" to them to watch for state changes which they must reflect in their client.

## Supported clients

Currently, only libraries for NestJS and React exist.
